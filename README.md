## TODO

- [ ] History includes the date, formats to ET
- [ ] Monkeytime


## Near-term
- [ ] Waveform is mono

- [ ] Waveform has overview and zoomed-in
- [ ] Auto re-draw the soundboard once a new sound is added
- [ ] import the sound effect history from old logs

## Bugs

## Distant features
- [ ] Monkeytime
- [ ] Check the length before doing download.
- [ ] sound effect pallets
- [ ] sound effect combos chain multiple sound effects together 
- [ ] command to generate sound effect usage graphs
