## TODO
- [ ] hook up the money on guess_sound
- [ ] add new sound effects
  - [ ] Timeout (with file cleanup)
- [ ] History includes the date, formats to ET
- [ ] Monkeytime


## Near-term
- [ ] Waveform is mono
- [ ] Waveform has time lines
- [ ] Waveform has overview and zoomed-in
- [ ] import the sound effect history from old logs
- [ ] Progress when downloading large audio file


## Bugs
- [ ] When you request while not in a voice channel, it should join whatever has people.
- [ ] Sometimes the tags/times are empty in the modal even though you just edited it.

## Distant features
- [ ] Check the length before doing download.
- [ ] sound effect pallets
- [ ] sound effect combos chain multiple sound effects together 
- [ ] command to generate sound effect usage graphs
- [ ] History refreshes (maybe at the bottom of the soundboar channel)
