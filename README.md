## Bugs

- [ ] Sometimes the tags/times are empty in the modal even though you just edited it.

## Distant features
- [ ] Check the length before doing download.
- [ ] sound effect pallets
- [ ] sound effect combos chain multiple sound effects together 
- [ ] command to generate sound effect usage graphs
